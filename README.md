# Botium Toys Internal IT Audit

This is a portfolio project from the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**.  
The project simulates performing an **internal IT audit** for a fictional company, Botium Toys, using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** 
and compliance standards (**PCI DSS**, **GDPR**, **SOC 1/2**).

## 📖 Scenario

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys.  
They operate from a single location that serves as the main office, storefront, and warehouse. 
With their growing online market in the U.S. and abroad, the IT department faces increasing pressure to support operations securely.

The IT manager initiated an **internal audit** to:
- Maintain compliance while expanding
- Protect critical assets
- Identify risks, threats, and vulnerabilities
- Ensure adherence to **PCI DSS** for online payments and **GDPR** for E.U. customers

## 🛠️ My Work

- Completed a **Controls & Compliance Checklist**:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Evaluated security controls against NIST CSF  
- Analyzed compliance readiness for PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC

## 🔎 Key Findings

- ❌ **No least privilege** – all employees can access customer and payment data  
- ❌ **No disaster recovery (DR) or backups** – threatens business continuity  
- ❌ **Weak password policy & no password manager** – increases credential risks  
- ❌ **No IDS** – limited ability to detect intrusions  
- ❌ **No encryption** – sensitive cardholder/PII data stored unencrypted  
- ✅ **Firewall & antivirus** – implemented and monitored  
- ✅ **Physical controls** – locks, CCTV, and fire detection systems in place  
- ✅ **EU breach notification plan** – in line with GDPR requirements
